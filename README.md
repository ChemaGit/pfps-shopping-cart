=============

### Authentication Data

For didactic purposes this information is made available to the readers but in a real application *THIS SHOULD NEVER BE MADE PUBLIC*.

For Admin users, the following environment variables are needed:

- `SC_JWT_SECRET_KEY`
- `SC_JWT_CLAIM`
- `SC_ADMIN_USER_TOKEN`

For access token (manipulation of the shopping cart):

- `SC_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET_KEY`

For password encryption:

- `SC_PASSWORD_SALT`

See the [docker-compose.yml](app/docker-compose.yml) file for more details.

## Tests

To run Unit Tests:

```
sbt test
```

To run Integration Tests we need to run both `PostgreSQL` and `Redis`:


```
docker-compose up
sbt it:test
docker-compose down
```

## Build Docker image

```
sbt docker:publishLocal
```

Our image should now be built. We can check it by running the following command:

```
> docker images | grep shopping-cart
REPOSITORY                    TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
shopping-cart                 latest              646501a87362        2 seconds ago       138MB
```

To run our application using our Docker image, run the following command:

```
cd /app
docker-compose up
```

## HTTP API Resources

If you use the [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) REST Client, you can import the shopping cart resources using the [insomnia.json](insomnia.json) file.
